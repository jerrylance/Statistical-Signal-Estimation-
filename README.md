I use MATLAB to solve some problems in ECE 6865

final project 

This is an CNN to classify image programï¼Œ has a detailed explanation.

CH7-13

Verify that the PDF of the MLE or sample mean is N(A,sigma^2/N)
Plot the theoretical and computer-generated PDFs for comparison.

CH7-24

Plot the periodogram for N=10 for the frequencies f0=0.25 and f0=0.05.
Use the noiseless data x[n]=cos(2*pi*f0*n), n=0,1,...,N-1

CH8-22 

By implementing a Monte Carlo computer simulation plot A[N] hat as given by (8.40). The data x[n]=A+w[n], w[n]is zero mean WGN delta(n)^2 = r^n, Use A =10, and r=1, 0.95, 1.05. Initialize the estimator by using A[0] hat = x[0] and var(A[0] hat)= var(x[0])= delta(0)^2=1.
Plot the gain and variance sequences.

CH11-2

Comparing the difference in posterior PDF.
p = e/sqrt(2*pi)*exp(-1/2*(theta-x).^2) + (1-e)/sqrt(2*pi)*exp(-1/2*(theta+x).^2);
betweent x1 = 2 and x2 = 1.1 when e = 1/2 and e = 3/4.
Next, find the MMSE and MAP estimators. Result in another paper, this is just the PDF figures.
